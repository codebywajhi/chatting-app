    "nodemon": "^2.0.22",
    "prompt": "^1.3.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.7.0"
  }
   in which all the server files you can get 
   I use sever socket.io dor response to the client 

  and for the client side I make a new client.js file and install all the npm packages to run the client-side code 
  then instructing to ask the prompt question to the user 

  
 You can run this app by typing 
# cd nodeServer
# nodemon server.js

 and it will start to run
